## Introduction to Red Teaming

Red teaming is an advanced form of security assessment that simulates real-world attacks against an organization's people, processes, and technology to identify vulnerabilities and test defensive capabilities. Unlike traditional penetration testing, red teaming adopts an adversarial approach, emulating threat actors' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to provide a realistic evaluation of security posture.

### Core Principles

- **Adversary Emulation**: Mimicking the behavior of specific threat actors relevant to the target organization
- **Stealth & Persistence**: Operating with minimal detection for extended periods
- **Comprehensive Scope**: Testing across technical infrastructure, physical security, and human factors
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Using plausible attack chains that reflect actual threats
- **Objective-Driven**: Focusing on specific high-value targets and business impacts

### Red Team vs Penetration Testing

| Aspect | Red Team | Penetration Testing |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **Goal** | Assess detection & response capabilities | Find and exploit vulnerabilities |
| **Scope** | Broad, often includes multiple attack vectors | Typically limited to specific systems |
| **Knowledge** | Limited information (black box) | Often detailed information (white/grey box) |
| **Timeframe** | Extended (weeks/months) | Limited (days/weeks) |
| **Stealth** | Critical component | Not typically prioritized |
| **Target Awareness** | Limited or no prior notification | Usually announced and coordinated |

## Red Team Fundamentals

### Red Team Mindset

The red team mindset requires shifting perspective from defensive to offensive thinking:

- **Adaptive Problem Solving**: Overcoming obstacles through creative solutions
- **Persistence**: Continuing efforts despite setbacks and roadblocks
- **Situational Awareness**: Understanding the environment and adapting accordingly
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying current with evolving threats and techniques
- **Ethical Boundaries**: Operating within defined scope and rules of engagement

### Red Team Engagement Types

- **Full-Scope**: Comprehensive assessment including technical, physical, and social engineering
- **Targeted**: Focus on specific critical assets or systems
